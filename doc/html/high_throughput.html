<h1>High Throughput Computing Administration Guide</h1>

<p>This document contains Slurm administrator information specifically
for high throughput computing, namely the execution of many short jobs.
Getting optimal performance for high throughput computing does require
some tuning and this document should help you off to a good start.
A working knowledge of Slurm should be considered a prerequisite
for this material.</p>

<h2>Performance Results</h2>

<p>Slurm has also been validated to execute 500 simple batch jobs per second
on a sustained basis with short bursts of activity at a much higher level.
Actual performance depends upon the jobs to be executed plus the hardware and
configuration used.</p>

<h2>System configuration</h2>

<p>Several system configuration parameters may require modification to support a large number
of open files and TCP connections with large bursts of messages. Changes can
be made using the <b>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</b> or <b>/etc/sysctl.conf</b> 
script to preserve changes after reboot. In either case, you can write values
directly into these files
(e.g. <i>"echo 32832 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max"</i>).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</b>:
The maximum number of concurrently open files.
We recommend a limit of at least 32,832.</li>
<li><b>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog</b>:
The maximum number of SYN requests to keep in memory that we have yet to get
the third packet in a 3-way handshake from.
The default value is 1024 for systems with more than 128Mb of memory, and 128
for low memory machines. If server suffers of overload, try to increase this
number.</li>
<li><b>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies</b>:
Used to send out <i>syncookies</i> to hosts when the kernels syn backlog queue
for a specific socket is overflowed.
The default value is 0, which disables this functionality.
Set the value to 1.
<li><b>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_synack_retries</b>:
How many times to retransmit the SYN,ACK reply to an SYN request.
In other words, this tells the system how many times to try to establish a
passive TCP connection that was started by another host.
This variable takes an integer value, but should under no circumstances be
larger than 255.
Each retransmission will take approximately 30 to 40 seconds.
The default value of 5, which results in a timeout of passive TCP connections
of approximately 180 seconds and is generally satisfactory.
<li><b>/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn</b>:
Limit of socket listen() backlog, known in userspace as SOMAXCONN. Defaults to
128. The value should be raised substantially to support bursts of request.
For example, to support a burst of 1024 requests, set somaxconn to 1024.</li>
<li><b>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</b>:
Identify the ephermeral ports available, which are used for many Slurm
communications. The value may be raised to support a high volume of
communications.
For example, write the value "32768 65535" into the ip_local_port_range file
in order to make that range of ports available.</li>
</ul>

<p>The transmit queue length (<b>txqueuelen</b>) may also need to be modified
using the ifconfig command. A value of 4096 has been found to work well for one
site with a very large cluster
(e.g. <i>"ifconfig <interface> txqueuelen 4096"</i>).</p>

<h2>Munge configuration</h2>

<p>By default the Munge daemon runs with two threads, but a higher thread count
can improve its throughput. We suggest starting the Munge daemon with ten
threads for high throughput support (e.g. <i>"munged --num-threads 10"</i>).</p>

<h2>User limits</h2>

<p>The <b>ulimit</b> values in effect for the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon should
be set quite high for memory size, open file count and stack size.</p>

<h2>Slurm Configuration</h2>

<p>Several Slurm configuration parameters should be adjusted to
reflect the needs of high throughput computing. The changes described below
will not be possible in all environments, but these are the configuration
options that you may want to consider for higher throughput.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>AccountingStorageType</b>:
Disabling storing of accounting by using the <i>accounting_storage/none</i>
plugin. Turning accounting off provides minimal improvement in performance.
If using the SlurmDBD increased speedup can be achieved by setting the
CommitDelay option in the <a href=slurmdbd.conf.html>slurmdbd.conf</a></li>
<li><b>JobAcctGatherType</b>:
Disabling the collection of job accounting information will improve job
throughput. Disable collection of accounting by using the
<i>jobacct_gather/none</i> plugin.</li>
<li><b>JobCompType</b>:
Disabling recording of job completion information will improve job
throughput. Disable recording of job completion information by using the
<i>jobcomp/none</i> plugin.</li>
<li><b>MaxJobCount</b>:
Controls how many jobs may be in the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon records at any
point in time (pending, running, suspended or completed[temporarily]).
The default value is 10,000.</li>
<li><b>MessageTimeout</b>:
Controls how long to wait for a response to messages.
The default value is 10 seconds.
While the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon is highly threaded, its responsiveness
is load dependent. This value might need to be increased somewhat.</li>
<li><b>MinJobAge</b>:
Controls how soon the record of a completed job can be purged from the
<b>slurmctld</b> memory and thus not visible using the <b>squeue</b> command.
The record of jobs run will be preserved in accounting records and logs.
The default value is 300 seconds. The value should be reduced to a few
seconds if possible. Use of accounting records for older jobs can increase
the job throughput rate compared with retaining old jobs in the memory of
the slurmctld daemon.</li>
<li><b>PriorityType</b>:
The <i>priority/builtin</i> is considerably faster than other options, but
schedules jobs only on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis.</li>
<li><b>SchedulerParameters</b>:
Many scheduling parameters are available.
<ul>
<li>Setting option <b>batch_sched_delay</b> will control how long the
scheduling of batch jobs can be delayed. This effects only batch jobs.
For example, if many jobs are submitted each second, the overhead of
trying to schedule each one will adversely impact the rate at which jobs
can be submitted. The default value is 3 seconds.</li>
<li>Setting option <b>defer</b> will avoid attempting to schedule each job
individually at job submit time, but defer it until a later time when
scheduling multiple jobs simultaneously may be possible.
This option may improve system responsiveness when large numbers of jobs
(many hundreds) are submitted at the same time, but it will delay the
initiation time of individual jobs.</li>
<li><b>sched_min_interval</b> is yet another configuration parameter to control
how frequently the scheduling logic runs. It can still be triggered on each
job submit, job termination, or other state change which could permit a new
job to be started. However that triggering does not cause the scheduling logic
to be started immediately, but only within the configured <b>sched_interval</b>.
For example, if sched_min_interval=2000000 (microseconds) and 100 jobs are submitted
within a 2 second time window, then the scheduling logic will be executed one time
rather than 100 times if sched_min_interval was set to 0 (no delay).</li>
<li>Besides controlling how frequently the scheduling logic is executed, the
<b>default_queue_depth</b> configuration parameter controls how many jobs are
considered to be started in each scheduler iteration. The default value of
default_queue_depth is 100 (jobs), which should be fine in most cases.</li>
<li>The <i>sched/backfill</i> plugin has relatively high overhead if used with
large numbers of job. Configuring <b>bf_max_job_test</b> to a modest size (say 100
jobs or less) and <b>bf_interval</b> to 30 seconds or more will limit the
overhead of backfill scheduling (NOTE: the default values are fine for both
of these parameters). Other backfill options available for tuning backfill 
scheduling include <b>bf_max_job_user</b>, <b>bf_resolution</b> and
<b>bf_window</b>. See the slurm.conf man page for details.</li>
<li>A set of scheduling parameters currently used for running hundreds of jobs
per second on a sustained basis on one cluster follows. Note that every
environment is different and this set of parameters will not work well
in every case, but it may serve as a good starting point.</li>
<ul>
<li>assoc_limit_continue</li>
<li>batch_sched_delay=20</li>
<li>bf_continue</li>
<li>bf_interval=300</li>
<li>bf_min_age_reserve=10800</li>
<li>bf_resolution=600</li>
<li>bf_yield_interval=1000000</li>
<li>partition_job_depth=500</li>
<li>sched_max_job_start=200</li>
<li>sched_min_interval=2000000</li>
</ul>
</ul></li>
<li><b>SchedulerType</b>:
If most jobs are short lived then use of the <i>sched/builtin</i> plugin is
recommended. This manages a queue of jobs on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis
and eliminates logic used to sort the queue by priority.
<li><b>SlurmctldPort</b>:
It is desirable to configure the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon to accept incoming
messages on more than one port in order to avoid having incoming messages
discarded by the operating system due to exceeding the SOMAXCONN limit
described above. Using between two and ten ports is suggested when large
numbers of simultaneous requests are to be supported.</li>
<li><b>PrologSlurmctld/EpilogSlurmctld</b>:
Neither of these is recommended for a high throughput environment. When they
are enabled a separate slurmctld thread has to be created for every job start
(or task for a job array).
Current architecture requires acquisition of a job write lock in every thread,
which is a costly operation that severely limits scheduler throughput.
<li><b>SlurmctldDebug</b>:
More detailed logging will decrease system throughput. Set to 2 (log errors
only) or 3 (general information logging). Each increment in the logging level
will increase the number of message by a factor of about 3.</li>
<li><b>SlurmdDebug</b>:
More detailed logging will decrease system throughput. Set to 2 (log errors
only) or 3 (general information logging). Each increment in the logging level
will increase the number of message by a factor of about 3.</li>
<li><b>SlurmdLogFile</b>:
Writing to local storage is recommended.</li>
<li><b>TaskPlugin</b>:
Avoid using <i>task/cgroup</i> with the combination of <i>ConstrainRAMSpace</i>
it is slower than other alternatives.  On the same note <i>task/affinity</i>
does not appear to add any measurable overhead.  Using task/affinity for
affinity is advised in any case.</li>
<li><b>Other</b>: Configure logging, accounting and other overhead to a minimum
appropriate for your environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SlurmDBD Configuration</h2>

<p>Turning accounting off provides a minimal improvement in performance.
  If using SlurmDBD increased speedup can be achieved by setting the CommitDelay
  option in the <a href=slurmdbd.conf.html>slurmdbd.conf</a></p>

<p>You might also consider setting the '<i>Purge*</i>' options in your
  slurmdbd.conf to clear out old Data.  A Typical configuration would
  look like this...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>PurgeEventAfter</b>=12months</li>
<li><b>PurgeJobAfter</b>=12months</li>
<li><b>PurgeResvAfter</b>=2months</li>
<li><b>PurgeStepAfter</b>=2months</li>
<li><b>PurgeSuspendAfter</b>=1month</li>
<li><b>PurgeTXNAfter</b>=12months</li>
<li><b>PurgeUsageAfter</b>=12months</li>

</ul>
